# Non-Blocking I/O Fix - Implementation Complete

## Summary of Changes

We have successfully implemented the non-blocking I/O solution to fix the blocking thread issue where orders saved to the database weren't being sent to instruments.

## Changes Made

### 1. InstrumentConnectionHandler.java
- **Added message queuing**: `BlockingQueue<AstmMessage> outgoingMessageQueue`
- **Added queueMessageForSending()**: Method to add messages to the queue instead of direct sending
- **Added processOutgoingMessages()**: Processes queued messages when instrument is ready
- **Modified run() loop**: Now calls both `receiveMessage()` and `processOutgoingMessages()` in non-blocking fashion

### 2. ASTMProtocolStateMachine.java
- **Made receiveMessage() non-blocking**: Added 100ms socket timeout
- **Enhanced thread safety**: Uses ThreadLocal tracking to allow same thread send/receive
- **Non-blocking message checking**: Uses `inputStream.available()` to check for data without blocking

### 3. OrderMessageService.java
- **Updated to use queueing**: Changed from `sendMessage()` to `queueMessageForSending()`
- **Simplified success handling**: Since messages are queued, we mark them as successful immediately

## How It Works

1. **Order Processing**: When an order is saved to DB, it's queued for sending instead of sent immediately
2. **Non-blocking Loop**: The connection handler runs a loop that:
   - Checks for incoming messages (with timeout, non-blocking)
   - Processes outgoing message queue when instrument is ready
3. **Message Delivery**: Messages in the queue are sent when the instrument is available and not busy

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Start the server
2. Use simulator option 12 to receive orders from server
3. Send an order via the web interface
4. Verify that:
   - Order is saved to database
   - Order appears in the outgoing message queue
   - Order is sent to the instrument (ENQ should appear in simulator logs)
   - No "unexpected character" errors occur

## Benefits

- **Non-blocking**: Server thread doesn't block waiting for incoming messages
- **Queue-based**: Orders are queued and sent when instrument is ready
- **Thread-safe**: Proper synchronization prevents race conditions
- **Robust**: Handles bidirectional communication without interference

## Architecture

```
[Order Save] → [Queue Message] → [Process Queue] → [Send to Instrument]
                      ↓
[Receive from Instrument] ← [Non-blocking Listen]
```

The fix ensures that sending and receiving operations don't interfere with each other, allowing proper bidirectional ASTM communication.
